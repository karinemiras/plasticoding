* Description: Sensor that measures the intensity this robot feels of a
*              radiating point somewhere in the distance. This is
*              parameterised by a couple of values. Say the distance of the
*              center of mass of the robot to the intensity source is `d`, we
*              then have parameters I+, `r` and `a` such that for the measured
*              intensity I it holds that:
*
*              I = I+				if d <= r
*              I = I+ * (r/d)^2		otherwise
*
*              This corresponds to a quadratic decrease with `r` - intensity
*              is maximal at `r`, 1/4 at 2r, 1/9 at 3r, etc.
